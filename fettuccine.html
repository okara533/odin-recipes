            Fettuccine pasta topped with a homemade rich decadent alfredo sauce 
            
            There are certain recipes that are essential to have in your recipe box and one of them has to be a phenomenal Fettuccine alfredo recipe.  Years ago, when I was teaching kids' cooking classes, this was one of the first things I taught them. Almost every single kid around goes crazy for alfredo sauce! It is so easy to make a homemade alfredo sauce that you will never buy the jarred variety again!
            
            This homemade alfredo sauce is made with simple ingredients -- butter, parmesan cheese, garlic, heavy cream, and salt. It's a 5-ingredient alfredo sauce that is beyond easy!

            If you are looking for a lighter version, I created a low-fat fettuccine alfredo version called Skinny Fettuccine Alfredo. You can find the recipe HERE.
            
            
            
            This homemade alfredo sauce can be tossed with the pasta so the pasta soaks up all of the sauce or it can be spooned over hot, fresh pasta.  I love to use fresh refrigerated fettuccine noodles because it tastes that much better. If you want the fettuccine alfredo to be a little more "saucy" toss the sauce with less than one pound of pasta</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb Fettuccine Pasta</li>
            <li>6 Tablespoons Butter</li>
            <li>1 Garlic Clove (minced)</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups Heavy Cream</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon Salt</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cup Shredded Parmesan Cheese</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon Pepper</li>
            <li>2 Tablespoons Italian Parsley (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large pot, heat water over high heat until boiling. Add salt to season the water. Once it is boiling, add fettuccine and cook according to package instructions. </li>

            <li>In a large skillet or pan, heat butter over medium heat. Add minced garlic and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in heavy cream. </li>
            
            <li> Let heavy cream reduce and cook for 5 to 8 minutes. Add half of the parmesan cheese to the mixture and whisk well until smooth. Keep over heat and whisk well until cheese is melted.</li>
            
            <li>Save some pasta water. The pasta water is full of flavor and can be used to thin out the sauce.</li>
            <li>Toss alfredo sauce with fettuccine pasta and add half of the parmesan cheese. Once it is tossed, garnish with the remaining parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>Add a little pasta water if it needs to be thinned out.</li>
            <li>Garnish with Italian parsley, if so desired.</li>
